# Cows & Bulls
An university assignment

# Rules (took from the Wikipedia)
One player (the Host) thinks of an isogram word (i.e. no letter appears twice) and, if the word length is not pre-determined, announces the number of letters in the word.
Other players (the Guessers) try to figure out that word by guessing isogram words containing the same number of letters.
The Host responds with the number of Cows & Bulls for each guessed word. As with the digit version, "Cow" means a letter in the wrong position and "Bull" means a letter in the right position.

# Features
In the options menu you can edit a difficulty (a word length), where EASY stands for a 4 letter word, NORMAL - 5 and HARD - 6.
You can also modify the number of tries.
You can save your stats to a txt file after each game.
